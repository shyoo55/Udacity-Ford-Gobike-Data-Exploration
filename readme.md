## Dataset

> As my source data, I selected Ford GoBike System Data. This data collection contains information about individual bike-sharing system trips. The dataset includes the following features: Start Station ID, Start Station Name, Start Station Latitude, Start Station Longitude, End Station ID, End Station Name, End Station Latitude, End Station Longitude, Bike ID, User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual), Member Year of Birth, Member Gender


## Summary of Findings

> Overall, there were a lot more subscribers utilizing the bike sharing system than casual customers. Obviously, the two categories of bikers have distinguishable usage patterns and riding behaviors. Subscribers utilized the system significantly on work days, focused around 8-9 a.m. and 17-18 p.m. for work commutes, and they are significantly older, whereas consumers ride a lot on weekends in the afternoon for entertainment purposes. Subscribers have considerably shorter/quicker journeys than consumers, which makes subscriber use more efficient because they go to work on a regular schedule.
The more relaxed and flexible pattern of customer use indicates that they utilize the bike sharing system differently than subscribers, mostly on weekends and in the afternoons for personal enjoyment.
. February was the most popular month of the year, owing to the weather and the fact that the data only includes the month of February.The majority of members did not use bike sharing for all of their journeys, and the majority were between the ages of 25 and 40, with the average age being 31. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The investigation reveals that the two kinds of riders have distinctive usage patterns/habits. On weekdays, Monday through Friday, subscribers utilize the system significantly, but on weekends, especially in the afternoon customers ride thire  bikes. On workdays, many trips are concentrated around 8-9 a.m. and 17-18 p.m., although customers prefer to use more in the late afternoon around 17 p.m. .Monday through Friday Subscribers' efficient/short period of usage coincides to their high concentration during rush hours Monday through Friday, showing that the service is mostly used for work commutes. The more relaxed and adaptable pattern of consumer use indicates that they utilize the bike sharing system differently than subscribers, mostly on weekends and in the afternoons, most likely for enjoyment reeson
